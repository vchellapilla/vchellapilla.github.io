        <p class="stories">In the spring of 2020, I took a class that taught me how to analyze data and then create visualizations that helped relay the data in a comprehensive way. Here are a few published projects I've worked on since then:</p>

        <p class="stories">In the spring of 2020, I took part in a nine-week long coding workshop hosted by the Penn State University Libraries - Code For Her. The workshop was a beginner's course for women and gender-diverse students at Penn State University Park that focused on web development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As part of my final project, I created this website from scratch over the course of two days.</p>
